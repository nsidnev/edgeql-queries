If you just need to get the query results, do not write anything after the name.
Such query will use `.query` from the driver:

`queries.edgeql`:
```edgeql
{!./src/queries-definition/query-operations/query-set/query_set0.edgeql!}
```

And python code:
```python3
{!./src/queries-definition/query-operations/query-set/query_set0.py!}
```

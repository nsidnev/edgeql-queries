"""Definition for parsing functions for queries.

Queries that are acceptable by this library should follow some rules:

1. They should be named.
2. Their names should not contain symbols that could not
    be used in Python identifier(**except for `-` symbol since
    it would be converted into `_`**)
3. They can have special symbols after their names that will change how
    this queries will be executed:
    * `*`: query will be executed as script with using `.execute` method from driver.
    * `+`: query will return a single object or `None` and executed with
        `.query_single` method from driver.
    * `!`: query will always return a single object and executed with
        `.query_required_single` method from driver.
    * empty: common query that will return a set of objects and will be executed with
        `.query` method from driver.

An example query that can be successfuly parsed:
```edgeql
    # name: select-user-by-username!
    # Find user by username and return it.
    SELECT User {
        username,
        bio,
        is_active
    }
    FILTER .username = <str>$username
    LIMIT 1
```
